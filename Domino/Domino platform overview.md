### Domino for data scientist
> https://www.dominodatalab.com/data-scientists/

* Remove DevOps pain with one-click unlimited compute and parallel experimentation  
Domino provides a technology foundation to meet the unique needs of experimentation and model development. Instantly run code on machines with up to **2TB of RAM and 100 cores**, or on specialized GPUs for deep learning; get all the power of Docker and containerization without being a DevOps expert.

* Accelerate research with your choice of innovative tools  
**Environments can be shared** among your colleagues but safely sandboxed from others.

* Eliminate re-work and painful reconstruction of experiments  
Domino **keeps code, environment details, data, discussions, parameters and results** for each experimental step.

* Reduce deployment friction with self-service model delivery  
Domino supports multiple modes of model delivery, so that models fit seamlessly into existing workflows and systems to maximize impact. Stakeholders can receive scheduled reports, use self-service web forms, and engage with full-fledged apps built in Shiny or Flask.
IT engineers of downstream systems can call batch and real-time APIs which are automatically versioned, secured, and highly available. Domino automatically tracks the full provenance—code, environments, data, parameters, and discussion—of a delivered model so that IT can validate, approve, or debug.

### Domino for insurance
> https://www.dominodatalab.com/solutions/insurance/

* Challenges  
Threats from Insurtech/ Shifting Operating Model(Buyers are more price sensitive and less loyal to brands)/ Complex Business Model(data sources— underwriting, claims and customer services, sales and marketing, broker)

* Benefits  
Identify New Segments(new market segments and product offerings with the right pricing strategy)/ Improve Risk Assessment(Underwriting and risk assessment are the core competitive advantages)/ Use Real-Time Data(real-time data)

* Trusted throughout the insurance industry  
get insights faster, produce better risk models, meet auditing requirements, and reproduce past work.
They use it for developing and deploying pricing models, loss models, model-driven claim insights, marketing models calculating customer value and churn predictions, delivering API-accessible risk models, and more.

* Examples  
**Allstate**: support claims processing, help deliver quotes, and predict thousands of decision-making actions across products, sales, operations, marketing, and claims. the team uses the Domino platform to reliably and securely develop, validate, deliver, and monitor new models for use cases like forecasting losses, uncovering new insights into claims, calculating customer lifetime value, and predicting potential customer churn.
multi-language environment/collaborate on code development, share feedback and iterate


### Domino platform  
> https://www.dominodatalab.com/resources/videos/domino-demo/
* Three main layers:  
infrastructure  
model factory: accelerate **development and delivery** of models and collaboration  
management consoles: **track** over all project portfolio healthy and key **rescources usage**
* model lifecycle
#### pre  
sharing and track history code (can also track input data)  
select any size **hardware tier**  
compute environment (software) (by using **docker**), the environment is also reusable and sharable  
#### building model  
embracing all the **innovation** happening in the **open source space**  
#### selecting model
run experiment in batch - form multiple experiments out at once  
#### reproducing work
track everything you need **(input/ output/hardware/ packages)**
#### launch pad
track user engagement
#### Model APIs
models need to be constantly interated on to drive business value. You can **deliver model as real time or batch**. Reducing the risk of **model drift**.
